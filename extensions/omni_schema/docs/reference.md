# Schema Management

This extension allows application schemas to be managed easily, both during development and deployment.

## Migrations

This extension provides `migrate_from_fs` function that executes SQL migrations from a file system (provided by the `omni_vfs` extension.)

```postgresql
select *
from
    omni_schema.migrate_from_fs(omni_vfs.local_fs('/path/to/project/migrations'))
```

It returns a set of `text` with each element being the file name executed.

The above invocation is most useful for development environment or deployment that is done with the backing of a local file system. In the near future, more file systems will be added, and that will facilitate more ergonomic scenarios.

!!! tip "Can't define a new filesystem?"

    You can specify `path` optional parameter to indicate where the migrations reside
    on the file system:

    ```postgresql
    select *
    from
      omni_schema.migrate_from_fs(omni_vfs.local_fs('/path/to/project'), 'migrations')
    ```

This function will recursively find all files with `.sql` extension and apply them ordered by path name, excluding those that were already applied before. For this purpose, it maintains the `omni_schema.migrations` table.

|         Column | Type      | Description                               |
|---------------:|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
|         **id** | int       | Unique identifier                         |
|       **name** | text      | Migration (file) name                     |
|  **migration** | text      | The source code of the migration          |
| **applied_at** | timestamp | Time of migration application [^grouping] |

[^grouping]: The timestamp defaults to `now()` which means that migrations applied in the same transaction all get the same value of `applied_at`, which can be used for grouping them together.

## Object reloading

For certain types of schema objects , it is possible to reload their contents without having to create a migration every time they change (which is fairly suboptimal, especially when it comes to tracking their changes in a version control system.)
The types supported are:

* **functions**
* **policies**
* **views**

This extension provides `load_from_fs` function that will reload all such
objects from a local on a file system (provided by the `omni_vfs` extension),
similar to `migrate_from_fs`:

```postgresql
select *
from
  omni_schema.load_from_fs(omni_vfs.local_fs('/path/to/project/migrations'))
```

Its return type and parameters are currently identical to those
of `migrate_from_fs`.

!!! tip "Ignoring files"

    In order to avoid loading particular files that match a language or a tool
    filename pattern, one can put `omni_schema[[ignore]]` somewhere inside such
    file (for example, in a comment) and `omni_schema` will not load it.

## Multi-language functions

Object reloading functionality allows one to load functions from '.sql' files
which can contain SQL or PL/pgSQL functions defined verbatim:

```postgresql title='test_function.sql'
create function test_function(a integer) returns integer
  language sql
as
$$
select a > 1
$$;

create function test_function(a integer) returns integer
  language plpgsql
as
$$
begin
  return a > 1;
end
$$;
```

Such files can contain multiple function definitions.

One can note, however, that SQL or PL/pgSQL is not always the best fit for a
particular problem. This is reflected in the fact that Postgres has an ecosystem
of other programming languages. However, writing code in those languages inside
of SQL files is a sub-par development experience: syntax highlighting,
auto-completion may not work; external tools that work with this languages are
unaware of this embedding technique.

To address this, this extension provides extensible support for custom
languages.

There are two components to this:

* in-file function signature directive (conceptually similar
  to [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)))
* `omni_schema.languages` tables that defines mapping of languages

The directive part is pretty simple: anywhere in the file, typically a comment
you can put a snippet that looks like this, enclosed within `SQL[[...]]`:

```python title='times_ten.py'
# SQL[[create function times_ten(a integer) returns integer]]
return a * 10
```

The extension is syntax-agnostic, so it'll look for this type of line anywhere,
comments, or code. It will then match the extension of the file to the language
and append the given `create function` line with an
appropriate `language ... as` construct and pass the contents of the entire file
to it
[^single-function-per-file].

!!! tip "Future vision"

    In the future, we want to be able to provide a more sophisticated 
    functionality to supported languages, like allowing to define _multiple 
    functions per file_, use native language annotation/type systems to 
    _infer the SQL function signature_ or detect language when file extensions
    are ambiguous (like `.pl` for Perl and Prolog).

[^single-function-per-file]: This means you can only define one function per
file at the moment.

Currently supported languages:

* SQL and PL/pgSQL (`.sql`) [^sql-languages-table]
* Python (`.py`)
* Perl (`.pl`, `.trusted.pl`)
* Tcl (`.tcl`, `.trusted.tcl`)
* Rust (`.rs`)

If an extension required for the support of a language is not installed, files
in that language will be skipped and a notice will be given, similar to this
one:

```
Extension pltclu required for language pltclu (required for foo.tcl)
is not installed
```

The support for languages is configurable through `omni_schema.languages` table:

|             Column | Type | Description                                                                            |
|-------------------:|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **file_extension** | text | Filename extension without the preceding <br/>dot. _Examples: `py`, `trusted.pl`, `rs` |
|       **language** | name | Language identifier to be used `create function ... language`                          |
|      **extension** | name | Extension that implements the language, if required                                    |

[^sql-languages-table]: SQL language is always supported, even if corresponding
entry is removed from `omni_schema.languages`. This behavior may change in the
future.
