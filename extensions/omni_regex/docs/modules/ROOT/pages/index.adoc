= Regex
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

This extensions provides https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2[PCRE2]-based regular expression functionality.
PCRE2 is feature-rich (for example, it provides named capture groups) and performant.

== `regex` type

This extension introduces a `regex` type which is effectively wrapping
a regular expression and defines operators and functions over it.

== Matching

Regular expressions can be matched against strings using `~` (with `!~` being
non-matching) or `=~` operators:

[source,sql]
----
select 'foo' ~ regex 'fo+';
--#> t
select 'bar' !~ regex 'foo';
--#> t
-- they also work the other way around:
select regex 'fo+' ~ 'foo';
--#> t
select regex 'foo' !~ 'bar';
--#> t
-- Same as `~`
select 'foo' =~ regex 'fo+';
--#> t
----

=== Extracting matches

`regex_match(text, regex)` will return `text[]` with all captured groups. If there are no
groups, will return an array with a single element:

[,sql]
----
select regex_match('ABC123', 'A.*');
--#> {ABC123}
select regex_match('ABC123', '([A-Z]*)(\d+)');
--#> {ABC,123}
----

To extract *multiple* matches, use `regex_matches(text, regex)`. It returns a `setof text[]`:

[,sql]
----
select regex_matches('foo1bar', '(fo+|bar)(\d?)');
--#> {foo,1}
--#> {bar,""}
----

== Named catpure groups

PCRE2 supports named capture groups (`(?<name>REGEX)`) and you can use `regex_named_groups(regex)`
to extract these. It returns a `table (name cstring, index int)` (where `index` is a 1-based index
of groups)

[,sql]
----
select index
from regex_named_groups('(fo+|bar)(?<num>\d?)')
where name = 'num';
--#> 2
----

support), modified to support named capture groups, parallelization and PCRE2.
