# Usage of pg_yregress

Despite being inspired by `pg_regress`, `pg_yregress` is not in any way compatible with `pg_regress` as it has a
different workflow and an execution model.

{% include-markdown "./_install.md" heading-offset=1 %}

## Basic workflow

This tool uses YAML to describe tests. Let's start with
`test.yml`:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: simple
    query: select 1 as value
```

The above specification will test the `select 1...` query be executing it and ensuring it was successful. The test will
be executed against a
_managed instance_[^managed] of Postgres.

[^managed]: Postgres instance that is provisioned and deprovisioned by `pg_yregress` tool without any user involvement.

Running `pg_yregress` against this file will produce output adhering to [TAP](https://testanything.org), Test Anything
Protocol for human or machine consumption.

```shell
$ pg_yregress test.yml
TAP version 14
1..3
# Initializing instances
ok 1 - initialize instance `default`
# Done initializing instances
ok 2 - simple
```

As the tool will evolve, we might add other ways to get this information.

??? tip "The above test can be further simplified"

    There's a reduced syntax for checking whether query is successful
    without naming it. You can even drop the `query` key and simply write the query
    as a test:

    ```yaml
    - select 1 as value
    ```

Nothing very interesting. Now, let's amend this test to test the result of this query. For a moment, let's assume we
don't know what results are to be returned.

```yaml
tests:
  - name: simple
    query: select 1 as value
    results: [ ] # (1)
```

1. Here we specify an empty result set

Re-running the tool will output something different:

```shell
$ pg_yregress test.yaml
...
tests:
- name: simple
  query: select 1 as value
  results:
  - value: 1
```

As you can see, it shows what test specification __should__
contain in order to pass. You can also observe, that `pg_yregress`
exited with a __non-zero error code__.

For better visibility into changes, YAML-specific diff tools can be of use, such
as [dyff](https://github.com/homeport/dyff). To make it easier to use these tools, `pg_yregress` takes an additional
_optional_ argument where it will output the updated specification instead of stdout.

Copying `results` to the original specification will make `pg_yregress`
return zero again (thus, signal that the specification is executed as expected.)

!!! tip

    Every `query` item is executed within an individual transaction that is rolled back
    at the end to ensure it does not interfere with other items.

## Handling JSON and JSONB

`pg_yregress` supports JSON types.

* If a supplied query parameter is a mapping or a sequence, it will be automatically converted to JSON strings
* If result value is of a JSON type, it will be converted to YAML value.

```yaml
- name: json and jsonb params
  query: select $1::json as json, $2::jsonb as jsonb
  params:
    - hello: 1
    - hello: 2
  results:
    - json:
        hello: 1
      jsonb:
        hello: 2

- name: json and jsonb results
  query: select json_build_object('hello', 1), jsonb_build_object('hello', 2)
  results:
    - json_build_object:
        hello: 1
      jsonb_build_object:
        hello: 2
```

## Testing for failures

You can simply test that a certain query will fail:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: error
    query: selec 1 as value
    error: true
```

The above will succeed, since we have set `error` to `true`.

But how we can test against specific error message? This can be done by
setting `error` to a more specific value:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: error
    query: selec 1 as value
    error:
      severity: ERROR
      message: syntax error at or near "selec"
```

The above will pass as this is the error this test fails with.

Multiple forms of `error` report are supported:

### Error message

```yaml
error: syntax error at or near "selec"
```

When passed as a scalar value, error message will be compared with the provided one.

### Full error form

```yaml
error:
  severity: ERROR
  message: <error message>
  # Optional
  detail: <error details>
```

In this form, both severity and message can be specified.

## Negative tests

A test can be marked negative when it should fail if the test itself passes. This is useful when testing scenarios where
something specific should
**not** happen.

```yaml
- name: 'string' should not be returned
  query: select my_fun() as result
  results:
    - result: string
  negative: true
```

The example is slightly contrived as we can test the assumption in the query itself, but at times it is easier or
clearer to have this specified as such "negative test".

## Multi-step tests

Some test inolve more than one query and we need to check for more than just the final result, so simply executing all
statements and queries delimited by a semicolon wouldn't be great.

For this use-case, instead of using `query`, use `steps`:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: Test
    steps:
      - query: create table tab as (select generate_series(1,3) as i)
      - query: select * from tab
        results:
          - i: 1
          - i: 2
          - i: 3
```

!!! tip

    The entire `steps` item is executed within an individual transaction and is rolled 
    back at the end to ensure it does not interfere with other items. Within `steps`,
    every item is not wrapped into a transaction and the results of each step are visible 
    in the next step.

## Grouping tests

There are cases when a number of tests that don't need to be executed in the
same transaction (like multi-step) but they do form a logical group
nevertheless. For example, testing different aspects of a feature, or different
inputs on the same function.

For this, one can use `tests`:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: fib
    tests:
      - query: select fib(0)
        results:
          - fib: 0
      - query: select fib(1)
        results:
          - fib: 1
      - query: select fib(2)
        results:
          - fib: 1
      - query: select fib(3)
        results:
          - fib: 2
```

## Committing tests

By default, all tests are rolled back to ensure clean environment. However, in
some cases, tests need to commit (for example, to test deferred constraints).

When this is necessary, the `commit` property of a test should be set
to `true`:

```yaml
- query: insert into table values (...)
  commit: true
```

This can be also used for multi-step tests. If any of the steps is committed but
the multi-step test itself isn't, it'll roll back the uncommitted steps.

## Reusing connections across tests

By default, new connections are created to execute each test. However, in
some cases, tests need to reuse the same connection.

When this is necessary, add `connection` key:

```yaml
- tests
    - name: reuse connection
    tests:
      - alter session set session_name='A';
      - connection: connA 
```

## Notices

One can also check their tests for notices:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: notices
    query: |
      do $$
        begin
          raise notice 'test 1';
          raise notice 'test 2';
        end;
      $$ language plpgsql
    notices:
      - test 1
      - test 2
```

One can also check a `steps`-based test the accumulated sequence of notices
(although testing individually in `query` steps is still possible):

```yaml
tests:
  - name: multi-step notices (individual)
    steps:
      - query: |
          do $$
            begin
              raise notice 'test 1';
            end;
          $$ language plpgsql
        notices:
          - test 1
      - query: |
          do $$
            begin
              raise notice 'test 2';
            end;
          $$ language plpgsql
        notices:
          - test 2
```

## Binary format

Sometimes there's a need to test binary encoding of types[^send-recv]. `pg_yregress`
allows this to be done by manipulating the `binary` property of the `query` test.

| Value     | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `true`    | Both `params` and `results` are binary |
| `params`  | `params` are binary                    |
| `results` | `results` are binary                   |

Binary encodings are done using hexadecimal notiation prefixed by `0x`.

This will return results as binary:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: binary format
    query: select true as value
    binary: true
    results:
      - value: 0x01
```

And this will return results as characters but take parameters as binary:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: binary format for params
    query: select $1::bool as value
    binary: params
    params:
      - 0x01
    results:
      - value: true
```

[^send-recv]: The encoding that is used by `SEND` and `RECEIVE` functions of the type.

## Skipping tests

If a test not meant to be executed, one can use `skip` directive to suppress its execution. Given a boolean scalar, if
it is positive, the test will be skipped. If a negative boolean scalar will be given, it will not be skipped. If any
other scalar will be given, it will be used as a reason for skipping the test.

```yaml
tests:
  - name: skip this
    skip: true
  - name: skip this for a reason
    skip: reason
```

Skipped tests don't need to have a valid instruction (`query` or `steps`).

If a skipped test is meant to be executed but shouldn't fail the execution of test suite in case if it fails,
`todo` directive can be used instead of `skip`.

```yaml
tests:
  - name: WIP
    todo: true
    query: select
```

## Resetting connection

Sometimes it is useful to reset a connection to the database to test certain
behaviors (for example, ensuring that functionality works across different
backend instances). For this, `reset` property can be set to `true`:

```yaml
tests:
  # ...
  - name: clean slate test
    reset: true
    query: ...
```

## Running queries outside explicit transaction block

All the test queries are executed inside an explicit transaction block (by executing `BEGIN`) to rollback or commit side
effects of tests but some queries like `CREATE DATABASE` fail
with `CREATE DATABASE cannot run inside a transaction block` if executed in a transaction block. To run such queries
set `transaction` property(`true` by default) to `false`:

```yaml
- name: create database outside transaction
  transaction: false
  query: create database another_db
```

## Connecting to another database

To connect to other database in a test set `database` property to name of the other database

```yaml
- name: connect to different database
  database: another_db
  query: select current_database()
  results:
    - current_database: another_db
```

## Configuring instances

Tests may have one more instances they run on. By default, `pg_yregress` will provision one. However, if you want to
configure the instance or add more than one, you can use
`instances` configuration which is a mapping of names to the configuration dictionaries:

```yaml
instances:
  configured:
    # Can be configured with a mapping
    config:
      log_connections: yes
  configured_1:
    # Can be configured with a string using `postgresql.conf` format
    config: |
      log_connections = yes
  default:
    init:
      # Executes a sequence of queries
      - create extension my_extension
    # One instance may be specified as default 
    default: yes
  other:
    init:
      - alter system set config_param = '...'
      # Initialization may require restarting the instance
      - restart: true
```

Each test will run on a default instance, unless `instance` property is
specified and the name of the instance is referenced.

You can also configure an instance with a custom `pg_hba.conf` file by using
`hba` key:

```yaml
instances:
  configured:
    hba: |
      local all all trust
      host all all all trust
```

This is useful when tests impose special authentication requirements.

You can configure default encoding and locale for databases in an instance by
using `encoding` and `locale` key:

```yaml
instances:
  configured:
    encoding: SQL_ASCII
    locale: en_US.UTF-8
```

### Single instance configuration

In case when only one instance is necessary but it needs to be configured,
instead of using `instances` and naming the default instance, one can use
`instance` key instead:

```yaml
instance:
  init:
    - create extension ltree
```

## Unmanaged instances

By default, `pg_yregress` manages Postgres instances itself: provisions the
database and its configuration, starts and stops processes. However, it can also
be used to run tests against other instances of Postgres operated outside of its
own workflow. This can be used for testing functionality or data patterns in an
existing database.

In order to use it, one has to pass one of the following options:

| Option        | Short | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --host        | -h    | Host to connect to. Defaults to `127.0.0.1` if other options are selected.                            |
| --port        | -p    | Port to connect to. Default to `5432` if not specified.                                               |
| --username    | -U    | Username. Defaults to current username.                                                               |
| --dbname      | -d    | Database name. Defaults to username.                                                                  |
| --password    | -W    | Force to prompt for a password before connecting to the database.                                     |
| --no-password | -w    | Never issue a password prompt. Will attempt to get a password from `PGPASSWORD` environment variable. |

For example, this will attempt to connect to a local Postgres instance on port
5432 using `omnigres` as a database name and a username, prompting for a
password:

```shell
pg_yregress -U omnigres -W tests.yml
```

!!! tip "Caveats"

    The following options are not available for unmanaged instances and will
    make pg_yregress terminate early with a corresponding error message.

    * `instance` and `instances` configuration keys
    * `restart` tests
    * `database`

## Configuring test suite

In certain cases, it may be useful to pass some configuration information to the
test suite itself. While it is generally recommended to avoid this, sometimes
it's right answer.

All test suites receive an implicit `env` mapping at the root that contains a
mapping of all environment variables. Using YAML Path (YPath) notation, one can
retrieve configuration specified through environment variables:

```yaml
- name: env
  query: select $1::text as user
  params:
    - */env/USER
  results:
    - user: */env/USER
```

### Named test suites

A test suite (the YAML file) can be given a human-readable name using
optional `name` property:

```yaml
name: Core tests

tests:
...
```
